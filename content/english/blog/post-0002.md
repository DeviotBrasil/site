Step by step guide to install Node-RED on Raspberry Pi via Docker

![Node-RED + Docker + Raspberry](/images/gallery/post-0002/1_TWqP4JHjcrAl0rmMh8uIpw.webp)

Update your Raspberry's OS:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Install Docker by running the command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

or

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io
```

Add your user to the Docker group, to avoid having to use sudo every time you run a Docker command:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Use the docker run command to start the Node-RED container with access to GPIOs. Access to GPIOs usually requires access to the /dev/gpiomem device.

Run the following command:

```bash
sudo docker run -d --name mynodered --restart always --privileged -p 1880:1880 -v node_red_data:/data --device /dev/gpiomem nodered/node-red:latest
```

Enabling the 1-Wire Interface on the Rpi. To do this, simply access the Raspi-Config page with:

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

Go to **Interfaces** and then to **1-Wire**, enable it and reboot the device.
