**Spec Kit** is a powerful tool to transform ideas into detailed technical plans and executable tasks using AI. Follow the steps below to set up your environment and start your project.

## 🛠️ Installation and Configuration

### Installing the UV Package Manager

`uv` is an extremely fast package installer for the Python ecosystem. Use the command below to install it:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Installing Spec Kit

Now, install the Spec Kit CLI directly from the official GitHub repository:

```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

### Project Initialization

Navigate to your project folder and initialize the Spec Kit environment:

```bash
specify init .
```

## 📝 Defining the Scope

### Create the Specification

This is where the magic begins! Use the `/specify` command focused on the business goal (the "what"), without worrying about the technology (the "how") yet.

```
/specify I want to build a web chat with generative AI. In this first version, the system will be open (no login), with a modern, minimalist and fully responsive design.
```

### Create the Technical Plan

Now, define the technological "recipe" using the `/plan` command.

```
/plan The project will be a monorepo. Frontend: React + Vite, TypeScript, Shadcn UI and TailwindCSS. Backend: Python with FastAPI, LangChain and LangGraph. LLM: OpenAI.
```

## 🧐 Refinement and Execution

### Validate the Plan with AI

Before coding, ask Copilot (or your preferred LLM) to act as a Software Architect and audit the plan's feasibility.

Audit Command:

```
Audit the implementation plan and detail files. Read with a critical eye to determine if there is a logical sequence of tasks. Reference the specific points in the implementation details where crucial information is located.
```

### Generate Tasks (Backlog)

Transform the plan into a list of granular and actionable tasks:

```bash
/tasks
```

### Automatic Implementation

Finally, ask Spec Kit to start generating code based on the validated plan:

```bash
implement .../.../plan.md
```
