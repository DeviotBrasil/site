## Understanding the DS18B20 Sensor

The DS18B20 is a digital temperature sensor known for its precision and ease of use. Its one-wire interface simplifies the connection process, making it a favorite among hobbyists and professionals. With its ability to operate over a wide temperature range, it is suitable for various applications, from home automation to industrial monitoring.

## Setting Up Raspberry Pi

Before diving into the sensor connection, make sure your Raspberry Pi is set up and running. You can install the Raspbian operating system, connect to the internet, and enable the SSH interface for remote access. Also, make sure your Raspberry Pi has the necessary GPIO pins available to connect the DS18B20 sensor.

## Requirements

On the Linux system where your Node-RED is running and where your sensors are connected, make sure you have loaded all the necessary kernel modules to work with 1-Wire devices, which is the DS1820 sensor. So you need to enable or have enabled the 1-Wire Interface on the Rpi. To do this, simply access the Raspi-Config page with:

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

Go to **Interfaces** and then to **1-Wire**, enable it and reboot the device. You're done.

## Required Node-RED Plugins

- node-red-dashboard
- node-red-contrib-ds18b20-sensor
