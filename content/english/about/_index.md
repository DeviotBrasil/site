I hold a degree in Information Systems, with 15 years of experience in systems development. Originally from Marília, I started my career in industrial automation, focusing on developing solutions for machine automation. Later, I moved to São Paulo, where I joined a multinational company and fell in love with both the company and the city.

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to collaborate with major companies such as JBS, Magalu, and Itaú, applying my knowledge to implement innovative and high-impact technology solutions.

I have a particular passion for IoT (Internet of Things), and I share my experiences and learnings on the subject through my YouTube channel, where I post videos and insights about this field.

Always seeking new challenges, I am currently diving deeper into the world of Machine Learning and Generative AI.
